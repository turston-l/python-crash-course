### Python Crash Course

* The purpose of this book is to make you a good programmer in general and a good Python programmer in particular. You’ll learn efficiently and
adopt good habits as I provide you with a solid foundation in general programming
concepts.

* After working your way through Python Crash Course,
you should be ready to move on to more advanced Python techniques, and
your next programming language will be even easier to grasp.

* In the first part of this book, you’ll learn basic programming concepts
you need to know to write Python programs. These concepts are the same
as those you’d learn when starting out in almost any programming language.

* You’ll learn about different kinds of data and the ways you can store data in
lists and dictionaries within your programs. You’ll learn to build collections
of data and work through those collections in efficient ways. You’ll learn to
use while loops and if statements to test for certain conditions so you can
run specific sections of code while those conditions are true and run other
sections when they’re not—a technique that greatly helps you automate
processes.

* You’ll learn to accept input from users to make your programs interactive
and to keep your programs running as long as the user is active.

* You’ll explore how to write functions to make parts of your program reusable,
so you only have to write blocks of code that perform certain actions
once and then use that code as many times as you like.

* You’ll then extend this concept to more complicated behavior with classes, making fairly simple programs respond to a variety of situations. You’ll learn to write programs that handle common errors gracefully. After working through each of these
basic concepts, you’ll write a few short programs that solve some well-defined
problems.

* Finally, you’ll take your first step toward intermediate programming by learning how to write tests for your code so you can develop your
programs further without worrying about introducing bugs. 

* All the information in Part I will prepare you for taking on larger, more complex projects. In Part II, you’ll apply what you learned in Part I to three projects. You
can do any or all of these projects in whichever order works best for you.

* In the first project (Chapters 12–14), you’ll create a Space Invaders–style shooting
game called Alien Invasion, which consists of levels of increasing difficulty.
After you’ve completed this project, you should be well on your way to being able to develop your own 2D games.

* The second project (Chapters 15–17) introduces you to data visualization.
Data scientists aim to make sense of the vast amount of information
available to them through a variety of visualization techniques. You’ll work
with data sets that you generate through code, data sets that you download
from online sources, and data sets your programs download automatically.

* After you’ve completed this project, you’ll be able to write programs that
sift through large data sets and make visual representations of that stored
information. 

* In the third project (Chapters 18–20), you’ll build a small web application called Learning Log. This project allows you to keep a journal of ideas
and concepts you’ve learned about a specific topic. You’ll be able to keep
separate logs for different topics and allow others to create an account and
start their own journals. You’ll also learn how to deploy your project so anyone
can access it online from anywhere.
